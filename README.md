# VBA-Challenge
This project explores the historical stock market data from 2014-2016.
In this lesson, we were given the following directions: 
Create a script using VBA that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:
  The ticker symbol
  Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  The total stock volume of the stock
  You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red
